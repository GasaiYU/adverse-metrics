# How to Run FID Metrics

## 1. Prepare Filelist

The format of each line of the **synthetic dataset filelist** and **real dataset filelist**
[] means when you calculate the kid and fid metric, the image label path is optional. However, when
you calculate the skvd metric, it is necessary.

```
image_path(.jpg), [image_label_path(.jpg)] ...
```

The image path you should add in the synthetic dataset filelist is the image generated by EPE or other generative model.

## 2. Run FID

Run as below in the same dir of the `cacl_fid.py`

```bash
python cacl_fid.py --fake_path <fake filelist> --real_path <real filelist> --metric [kid/fid/skvd]
```

The option choice is the **num_crops** and **subset_size**. You can refer to the code.
